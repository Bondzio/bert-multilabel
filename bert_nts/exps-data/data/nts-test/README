The test set for the CLEF eHealth 2019, Task 1 (Multilingual Information Extraction) (more info at [1]) consists of the following folder and files:

- docs/: folder containing 407 documents that are summaries of animal experiments which are originally available in [2]. Each document is identified by an identifier (the file name) and  contains 6 lines of text, as follows:

1. title of the document;
2. uses (goals) of the experiment;
3. possible harms caused to the animals;
4. comments about replacement (in the scope of the 3R principles);
5. comments about reduction (in the scope of the 3R principles);
6. comments about refinement (in the scope of the 3R principles).

All documents are in the German language and consist of summaries of animal experiments recently carried out in Germany (more info in our publication [3]).

- anns_test.txt: file containing all annotations (ICD-10 codes) for the documents to which codes have been assigned. Some documents have no ICD-10 codes assigned to them. Some examples of the annotations are shown below:

17288	J95-J99|X
4970	C50-C50|C00-C97|C00-C75|II
3673	V

Each line contains a document identifier, separated by a TAB symbol, to the list of one or mode ICD-10 codes. In this list, codes are serarated by a pipe symbol (|). 

All codes are chapters or groups from the ICD-10 German Modification 2016 version [4]. 

- ids_test.txt: file containing the list of identifiers (one per line) that belong to the test set.
